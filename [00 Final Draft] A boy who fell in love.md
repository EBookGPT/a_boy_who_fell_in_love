Please provide me with the input that you want me to insert into the outline. I need the text that you want to use to fill in the placeholders. 

For example, you might want to provide me with:

* **Specific details about the "true story" element** - Is it based on a real event, a personal experience, or a family secret? 
* **Ideas for character development** - What are Ethan and Amelia's dreams, fears, and insecurities? What makes them unique?
* **A specific conflict or obstacle** - What challenges will Ethan and Amelia face in their relationship?

Once I have this information, I can help you build a compelling and original outline for your true story, love story.
